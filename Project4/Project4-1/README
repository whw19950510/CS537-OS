Finish a simple thread-pool server, which can response to mulltiple HTTP
requests at the same time. Use a queue as buffer to hold pending requests,
use thread-pool to continuely consume the requests. Can add more scheduling
pattern for the queue buffer, such as work with shortest time requests first.
